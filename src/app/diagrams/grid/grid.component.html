<h1>Grid</h1>
<div class="text-block">
  <p>
    The diagram is drawn in a <strong>grid</strong> which is made out of blocks.
    Itâ€™s optional to display. The grid has a
    <strong>padding of 1 block</strong>. Also
    <strong>optional are the blocks and frames scales</strong>. The
    <strong>block scale</strong> is mainly here to position components. It is
    <strong>very rarely used</strong>. The
    <strong>frame scale is here to measure the exact time</strong> in diagrams.
    For a consistent appearance we suggest a
    <strong>minimal with of 38 blocks</strong>.
