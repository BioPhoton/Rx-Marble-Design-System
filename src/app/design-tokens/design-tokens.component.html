      The unit for width and height in marble diagrams is called a block.
      <strong>A block is a rectangle with equal width and height</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>Positioning of objects and text is also measured in blocks.</p>
    <p>
      To have a convenient unit we use
      <strong>em with the base of 1 block</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes time matters. The smallest unit of time is called frame.
      <strong>A frame is a unit for time</strong> and expressed in width.
      <strong>1 frame equals to the width of 2 blocks</strong>.

<h2>Font</h2>
<p>
  Text is used to name things or give more information to a specific part of a
  diagram like observables, operators and events like subscribe or unsubscribe.
  It is furthermore used in notifications to give more detailed information
  about their content.
</p>

<h3>Font-Face</h3>
<p>
  The design guide doesnâ€™t limit the choice of font. <br />Only a few
  limitations are suggested. <br />Serif font-face and mono-space letter.

    <h4>Mono-space</h4>
    <p>
      Mono-space font has to be used in the description of observables,
      operators or in the text of notifications. This ensures that the with of
      text is directly proportional to the number of characters and therefore
      simplifies the positioning and alignment of text in diagrams.

    Lines are here to symbolize time. Time without a measurement as line or area
    as shown with [1] and [5], a specific time period is shown under [4] or an
    interaction at a specific point in time ilke in [2] and [3]. The interaction
    can be initialized from the consumer [2] to the producer [3,6]. Lines from
    the consumer side [2] have in some cases description in form of the letters
    S, U and C. Some lines from the producer side [6] can be angled. This is
    possible to the right side only. [7] [8]
