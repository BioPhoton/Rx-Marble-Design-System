<h1>Rx Marble Design System</h1>
<h4>A design system to visualize functional reactive programming with <a

</h4>

As this is work in progress and the migration will take some time
we refer to the current version <a

<h1>The idea behind the MarbleDesignSystem</h1>

<p>
  Marble diagrams serve a method for us to visualize processes over time.
  This helps programmers and engineers to understand and design reactive
  processes.
  <br>
  The overall goal of the MarbleDesignSystem is to provide a unified way of
  reading and creating stream based diagrams,
  in particular one specific type of it, the marble diagrams.
  <br>
  This guide explains all building blocks of the design system step by step and
  in detail.
</p>

<p>
  In general we have some main rules that system follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Consistent</li>
  <li>Intuitive</li>
  <li>Easy</li>
  <li>Detailed</li>
  <li>Customizable</li>
</ul>

<h2>Consistency</h2>
<p>
  There are several things to follow if you try to create a standard. One of
  them if more critical for a positive outcome than everything else,
  consistency.
  By working with a standardized, reproducible approach we managed to create a
  consistent way of drawing marble diagrams.
  A set of rules developed over many many iterations, adopted and simplified to
  serve as a guideline and blueprint for creating and using these diagrams.
</p>
<h2>Intuitive</h2>
<p>
  As programming with Rx is hard we made sure to keep it intuitive.
  By including a lot of people into the process of the creation of this guide we
  collected a lot of personal feedback to improve the system.
  To make sure we consider a common way interpretation we created several public
  polls we were collected and evaluated the general understanding.
  This helped us to make our system intuitive to understand.
</p>
<h2>Easy</h2>
<p>
  As mindset behind the system are several principles. One of them is “Easy to
  adopt and create”, which means we want to provide a way for everybody to read
  and create marble diagrams.
  To achieve this we create all diagrams in either googleSlides oder Powerpoint.
  We believe this two options enable a big group of people to edit and draw
  these diagrams.
</p>
<h2>Detailed</h2>
<p>
  Marble diagrams exist since a long time now. As there was no well thought
  standard out there and not all edge cases considered, people started to create
  their own solutions to visualize processes. These let to a variety of
  different ways of drawing these diagrams. Some of the better approaches were
  able to visualize more complex prozesses, but there is one essential thing
  which nobody considered yet, but which is most critical to understand
  processes based on Rx. The internal behavior of operators.
  This system is not only providing a consistent, standardized way of drawing
  marble diagrams, but also offers a way to visualize the internals of
  operators. Of course based on the systems rules it selfe.

Text is used to name things or give more information to a specific part of a
diagram like observables, operators and events like subscribe or unsubscribe.
It is furthermore used in notifications to give more detailed information about
their content.
