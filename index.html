<h1> The idea behind the MarbleDesignSystem </h1>

<p>
  <b>
    Diagrams have the unique ability to express complex things simply.
    <br>
    Never had reactive programming been made so visual.
    <br>
    Diagrams is transforming information into compelling images
  </b>
</p>

<p>
  Marble diagrams serve a <b>method for </b>
  us to visualize processes over time.
  This helps programmers and engineers to understand and design reactive
  processes.

  The overall goal of the MarbleDesignSystem is to provide a unified way of
  reading and creating stream based
  diagrams,
  in particular one specific type of it, the marble diagrams.

  This guide explains all building blocks of the design system step by step and
  in detail.
</p>
<p>
  In general we have some main rules that system follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Consistent
  </li>
  <li>
    Intuitive
  </li>
  <li>
    Easy
  </li>
  <li>
    Detailed
  </li>
  <li>
    Customizable
  </li>


</ul>
<h2>Consistency</h2>
<p>
  There are several things to follow if you try to create a standard.
  One of them is more <b>critical for a positive outcome </b>
  than everything else, <b>consistency</b>.
</p>

<p>
  By working with a <b>standardized, reproducible approach </b>
  we managed to create <b> a consistent way </b> of drawing marble diagrams.
  <b> A set of rules </b> developed over many many iterations, adopted and
  simplified to serve as a guideline and blueprint for <b> creating and
  using </b>
  these diagrams.
</p>

<h2>Intuitive</h2>

<p>
  As programming with Rx is hard we made sure to keep it intuitive.
</p>

<p>

  By <b> including </b>a lot of <b>people</b> into the process of the creation
  of this guide we collected a lot of <b>personal feedback</b> to improve the
  system.

</p>

<p>

  To make sure we consider <b> a common way</b> interpretation we created
  several <b>public polls</b>
  we were collected and evaluated the general understanding.
  This helped us to make our system <b>intuitive to understand</b>.

</p>
<h2>
  Easy
</h2>

<p>

  As mindset behind the system are several principles.
  One of them is <b>“Easy to adopt and create”</b>, which means we want to
  provide <b>a way for everybody</b> to
  <b>read and create</b> marble diagrams.

</p>

<p>
  To achieve this we create all diagrams in either googleSlides oder Powerpoint.
  We believe this two options <b> enable</b> a big group of <b>people</b> to <b>edit
  and draw </b> these diagrams.
</p>

<h2>
  Detailed
</h2>


<p>
  Marble diagrams exist since a long time now.
  As there was no well thought standard out there and not all edge cases
  considered,
  people started to create their own solutions to visualize processes.
  These let to a variety of different ways of drawing these diagrams.
  Some of the better approaches were able to visualize more complex prozesses,
  but there is one essential thing which nobody considered yet,
  but which is most critical to understand processes based on Rx. The internal
  behavior of operators.

</p>

<p>
  This system is not only providing a consistent, standardized way of drawing
  marble diagrams,
  but also offers a way to visualize the internals of operators.
  Of course based on the systems rules it selfe.

    <p>The unit for width and height in marble diagrams is called a block.
      A block is a rectangle with equal width and height.

      Positioning of objects and text is also measured in blocks.

      To have a convenient unit we use em with the base of 1 blok.

      Sometimes time matters. The smallest unit of time is called frame.
      A frame is a unit for time and expressed in width. 1 frame equals to the width of 2 blocks.
